# dlnd-tv-script-generation

This is my solution to the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) TV script generation project.

In this project, i used a script from the [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV show to generate a fake script using RNNs.

# Dependencies

* Install [Python 3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads)
* Install [Jupyter 5.7.0](https://jupyter.org/install)

# How To Use

1. Clone the project
2. Run `jupyter notebook`
3. Edit `dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb`

**Note:** I suggest to train this model using GPU

# dlnd-tv-script-generation

This is my solution to the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) TV script generation project.

In this project, i used a script from the [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV show to generate a fake script using RNNs.
